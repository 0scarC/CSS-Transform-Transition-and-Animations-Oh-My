# Transition Activity


## Getting Started

- open `index.html` in your text editor and the browser
- open `activity.css` in your text editor

## Using transform

Add a transform rule to the `button` element in `activity.css`

So that you can slowly change the button background color to `cornflowerblue` over 2 seconds when you hover your pointer over the button.

### Bonus

When you hover over the button, it pushes the image credit link down causing an undesirable moving/bouncing. Update the CSS (you can work in main.css) to make it that hovering over the button has no effect on the other elements on the page

### Super Bonus!

Use the following resource and refactor the code so that the caption title and text overlays the image like in the following:
